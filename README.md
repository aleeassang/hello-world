Learning how to use GitHub 's repositories
Learning how to code has been an interesting journey. I have learnt the skill of never giving up as it have taken me many false starts to reach as far as I have. Sometimes all we need is a change in perspective!
At the moment I am learn JS and so far I am enjoying the mindwarp that comes with learning a new skill.
